# IP cameras
An Internet Protocol camera, or IP camera, is a type of digital video camera that receives control data and sends image data via an IP network.<br>
Some IP cameras require support of a central network video recorder (NVR) to handle the recording, video and alarm management. Others are able to operate in a decentralized manner with no NVR needed, as the camera is able to record directly to any local or remote storage media.
